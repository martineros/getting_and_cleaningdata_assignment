The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in 
the course project’s definition.

1. Download the dataset
      Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

2. Assign each data to variables
      features <- features.txt 
      the features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.

      activities <- activity_labels.txt 
      list of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)

      subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt 
      contains test data of volunteer test subjects being observed

      x_test <- test/X_test.txt 
      contains recorded features test data

      y_test <- test/y_test.txt 
      contains test data of activities’code labels

      subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt 
      contains train data of volunteer subjects being observed

      x_train <- test/X_train.txt 
      contains recorded features train data
      
      y_train <- test/y_train.txt 
      contains train data of activities’code labels


3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
      x_total is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
      y_total is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
      subject is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
      merged_data is created by merging subject, y_total and x_total using cbind() function

4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
      tidy_data is created by subsetting merged_data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the 
      measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
      Entire numbers in code column of the tidy_data replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column 
      of the activities variable

      Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
          code column in TidyData renamed into activities
          All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
          All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
          All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
          All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
          All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
          All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each 
activity and each subject
          final_data is created by sumarizing tidy_data taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, 
          after groupped by subject and activity.
          Export FinalData into FinalData.txt file.
