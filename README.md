CodeBook.md 
a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

run_analysis.R 
performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:

step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

step 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for 
each activity and each subject.

FinalData.txt is the exported final data.
